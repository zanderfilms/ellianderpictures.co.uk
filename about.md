Elliander Pictures is a UK-based production partnership between directing brothers Elliot Weaver ({{ elliotAge }}) and Zander Weaver ({{ zanderAge }}), producing both factual television and narrative dramatic content.

Since 2010 the company has produced over nine hours of factual programming for broadcasters including *Discovery*, *PBS*, *Canal+* and *UKTV* and is currently completing post-production on the self-produced feature film, COSMOS.

The brothers plan to continue producing documentaries but shift their focus to directing feature films, where their passion lies.
