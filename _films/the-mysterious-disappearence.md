## Synopsis

The Mysterious Disappearance of M.M.Bayliss is an homage to classic Victorian ghost stories and the weird tales of the Twilight Zone serials.

A young man is woken one night by a set of haunted keys that float before him. Guided through his empty house by the possessed keys, he discovers a dark room hiding an even darker secret.

This short film was shot on only 800ft of 16mm Fuji-film to achieve the distinct and unique aesthetic audiences associate with the classic ghost films of the past.
