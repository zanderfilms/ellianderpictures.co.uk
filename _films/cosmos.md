## Synopsis

COSMOS is a contemporary sci-fi mystery following three amateur astronomers who accidentally intercept what they believe is a signal from an alien civilisation. Realising they may have just stumbled across Mankind's greatest discovery, they must race to document their finding, prove its authenticity and share it with the world before it is lost forever. But the truth they uncover is even more incredible than any of them could have imagined.

Inspired by Amblin-era adventure, set over one night and against the backdrop of a World changing discovery, COSMOS offers spectacle and thrills but reminds us success is nothing without people to share it with.

> _COSMOS is a no-budget feature. Directing brothers, Elliot Weaver & Zander Weaver, self produced the project, taking on all major crew roles throughout production, with the exception of writing the score._
